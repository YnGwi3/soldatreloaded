// Demos (the original's Demo.pas): a game as this client saw it, kept in a file and
// played back. A demo is what the server said, every packet as it came, between marks
// of where the client's frames and ticks fell among them; and, each tick, my own part,
// which the server never says back to me: my command and my soldier as the tick left
// it. Played back, the packets go down the same road the line's do (client_net_feed),
// at the same frames and ticks, so the world is made from them as it was; my soldier
// steps on my commands, so my shots fly as they flew, and is put where it stood.
//
// A file (.srdm, in demos/) is a header, then records: a kind byte, a little-endian
// u16 size, and that many bytes.
//
//   header  "SRDM", u16 DEMO_VERSION, u16 NET_VERSION, u32 when it began (Unix
//           seconds), u32 its ticks (written as it closes; a file cut short says 0 and
//           is counted as it opens), u8 my slot, my name (NET_NAME_SIZE bytes), the map
//           (NET_MAP_SIZE bytes)
//   packet  a message as the server sent it, its kind first
//   frame   the frame's packets are all in: what they began (a map, a round's end, a
//           vote, a line of chat) is taken now, before the ticks
//   tick    one tick: the tick on show, my command, my cursor, and my soldier if it is
//           in the game (its owned half, its loadout, look and typing, its bink and its life)
//
// A demo begun mid-round (demo_record_join) starts with the round's Map, the vote on,
// and the snapshots the client keeps for its deltas, whole, with the server's events
// still to show, so the packets that follow have every base they were sent against.
// Only a demo of this NET_VERSION plays: the packets are its wire.
