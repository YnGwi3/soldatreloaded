// Input is the keys and mouse, run through the console's binds. Every key has a name
// ("a", "space", "f1", "mouse1", "mwheelup"...), and a key going down or up runs its
// bind (console_key). The soldier's buttons are commands for the binds to run:
//
//   +left +right +jump +crouch +prone +jet +fire +throw +reload +change +drop
//   +flagthrow
//
// A button is held while any key bound to it is down. One-shot presses (throw, change,
// prone, drop) are latched the moment they go down and cleared by input_clear after the
// tick that used them, so a press between two ticks is never lost and never counted
// twice. Keys are named by their place on the keyboard (SDL's scancodes), as the
// original binds them, so "w" is the key above "s" on any layout.
//
// A key pressed with a modifier held is looked up as "alt+w", "ctrl+w" or "shift+w"
// first, and as "w" when that has no bind, so Alt+W can say something while W alone
// still jumps. A key goes up under the name it went down with, so what a +cmd began, the
// release always ends. The modifier keys are keys too: "alt" itself can hold the radio
// menu open.
//
// The mouse is the original's: SDL's relative mode locks the system cursor in the
// window and the game keeps its own, moved by the raw deltas times the sensitivity and
// clamped to the view, in the view's units (480 tall, however big the window), so it
// feels the same at any window size (opensoldat's ControlGame.pas, SDL_MOUSEMOTION).
//
// The default binds, Soldat's:
//   A / D  left / right    W  jump    S  crouch    X  prone    Space  jet
//   left mouse  fire    right mouse / E  throw    R  reload    Q  change    F  drop
// And, not a bind: with the weapons menu open, Ctrl+1 to Ctrl+4 pick the secondary
// (colt, knife, chainsaw, LAW), as the original's do.
