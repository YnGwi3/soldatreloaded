// The consoles the HUD shows, the original's TConsole (Console.pas) as the client keeps
// two of them: the main console in the corner, a few lines that scroll away, and the
// big console, the same lines kept long, shown in its place while a line is typed.
// Both are fed from the game console's scrollback (console.h), so whatever is printed
// there, a cvar echoed, a line of chat, the server's word, shows in the HUD.
//
// The scrolling is the original's: a line is added at the bottom and, when the console
// is full, the oldest goes; each tick a clock runs, and when it reaches its mark the
// oldest line goes once; a new line sets the clock back by a wait, so the console holds
// still for a while after every line and empties one line at a time when nothing
// comes. (The clock is never reset by the scroll itself, as in the original, so after
// a lone line only that one goes.)
