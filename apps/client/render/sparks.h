// The particle effects: chips off walls, blood, smoke, explosions, shell casings and
// clips, the jets' flames, the flames off a burning body. From Sparks.pas and the
// bursts in Bullets.pas, SpriteEffects.pas and Sprites.pas, by way of soldat-odin's
// r_sparks.odin; only the styles our events produce. Purely cosmetic, so they use their
// own rng, not the sim's, and are fed from the tick's events rather than reached into
// by the simulation.
//
// Some sparks make a sound: a casing or a clip landing, the crackle of a burning body.
// Those are rolled here, with the spark, and left in `sounds` for the audio to play
// after the tick (the original plays them from TSpark.CheckMapCollision and the
// sprite's fire loop, in the same breath as it makes the spark).
