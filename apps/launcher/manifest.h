// A manifest: what an install of one version holds, file by file, which `xmake dist`
// writes and the launcher checks an install against. Text, a line to a fact:
//
//   version 0.5.0
//   package full <sha256> <bytes> soldatreloaded-0.5.0-windows-x64.zip
//   file <sha256> <bytes> data/maps/ctf_Ash.pms
//
// The path or name is the rest of the line, so it may hold spaces ("Soldat
// Reloaded.exe"); blank lines and // comments are skipped. The installed copy
// (manifest.txt, inside the packages) has the version and the files; the release's
// (latest-<platform>.txt, beside the package) adds where to get it ("package update", an
// older release's second, smaller package, is read and passed over). It lists every file a
// release ships; what the launcher does with each, by where it lies, is update.h's. The
// player's own files (their mods, demos/) are never listed.
