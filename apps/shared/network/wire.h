// The events on the wire (docs/netcode.md). The simulation's own event list is the
// vocabulary of what happens; a table here says which of them travel, and from whom:
//
//   WIRE_LOCAL   a consequence every machine produces for itself, or one system asking
//                another within a machine; never sent
//   WIRE_OWNER   a decision of the soldier's owner: its shot, its weapon or flag thrown.
//                A client sends its own to the server, which relays them to everyone
//                else and does them as its own
//   WIRE_SERVER  a decision only the server makes: a wound, a kill, a respawn, a
//                pickup, the round; sent to everyone, done by their passes
//
// Each side numbers the events it sends in a queue; a packet carries those the other
// side has not acknowledged, capped, so a lost packet is covered by the next. The
// receiver applies each once, by number, into the game's mailbox (game_hear), stamped
// with the tick it happened; a shot heard is run forward from then to now.
