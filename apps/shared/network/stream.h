// The two streams (docs/netcode.md): the client's state every tick, the server's
// snapshot every tick, both unreliable and both delta-compressed against the newest
// the other side acknowledged, the acknowledgement riding in the packet going the other
// way. Both ends of both streams are here, so the tests can drive either.
//
// Client state: the owned half of the client's soldier, numbered; the server takes it
// as written after its checks (soldier_copy_owned). It is a delta against the client's
// own earlier state the server last acknowledged, which both keep in a ring; whole
// when there is none young enough.
//
// Snapshot: numbered by the server's tick. For every slot a word: no soldier, the
// soldier's halves, or nothing this time (held back to fit the datagram; the client
// keeps stepping it). A soldier's halves are a delta against the snapshot the client
// last acknowledged, if that snapshot carried the soldier, and whole otherwise; the
// server deltas against what it sent, out of the world's history ring, and the client
// against what it received. The client applies the served half of everyone and the
// owned half of everyone but itself, and its own only on a new life: a placing.
//
// Between words, everyone steps a soldier heard of on its last keys (stream_command),
// one-shot buttons cleared so a throw is not thrown again; after STREAM_RELEASE_TICKS
// of silence the keys are let go and it falls and stops.
//
// The client's view (client_stream_begin_tick): its world's tick is the server tick of
// the frame it shows, and it keeps that `interp` ticks behind the newest snapshot it has,
// so the snapshot of each tick is in hand when the tick comes, whatever the line's
// jitter, and is applied then, with the server's events of that tick. A snapshot that
// comes after its tick has passed is a late one, and raises `interp` for a while; a tick
// with no snapshot steps everyone on. The clock itself runs free and is nudged a tick
// at a time when the frames in hand run consistently over or under.
