// Sounds, from Sound.pas and the play sites in Sprites.pas, Bullets.pas and
// SpriteEffects.pas by way of soldat-odin's ss_audio.odin, on SDL's audio device:
//
//   - one sample per wav, read on first use into the device's format; a play takes a
//     free voice from a small pool, or the oldest playing
//   - every play is placed from the listener, the soldier the camera follows (me while I
//     live, whom I watch while dead) or the free camera: gain volume * (1 - d / 750), cut
//     past that, panned by the direction; a sound with no place comes from the camera
//   - four reserved voices per soldier (reload, jets, gattling, gattling2, the layout
//     of Sprites.pas): a voice already playing is refreshed, not restarted, and a
//     wind-up is cut by stopping its voice. The loops (jets, chainsaw, flamer, wind)
//     wrap in the mixer, as the original's AL_LOOPING sources do, while they are played
//     every tick; out of earshot a playing one is kept, silent, not stopped, as the
//     original leaves its source playing
//   - with snd_effects_battle, past half the range a shot or blast also plays its
//     distant sample; with snd_effects_explosions, a blast next to me rings the ears
//     (hum) and fades every sound but the hum for a few seconds. Both are off unless
//     asked for, as the original's are
//   - one departure from the original: everything that happens in the game is placed
//     where it happened, the flag's return, score and drop included, which the
//     original plays flat from the camera. What is mine alone (my death, my headshot,
//     the ringing, the clock, the menus) stays flat.
//
// What plays when: the events (each tick's), each soldier's state against the tick
// before, bullets passing me, and the clock's beeps, all from audio_tick once per
// tick. Purely a listener: nothing here changes the game.
