// What the game's events say to the player: the kill console, the big messages and the
// console's lines about flags and the match. Fed from the tick's events, so it is the
// same alone and online, where the server's events come down the wire. Ported from the
// original's KillConsole and BigText calls in Client.pas and Game.pas.

// The kill console scrolls as the original's (Console.pas): a line's arrival holds it
// for a moment, then the oldest line goes once (two, when the newest is a victim's),
// and the rest stay until the next kill; a full console drops its oldest as one comes.
