// The console, Quake 3's in miniature: cvars, commands, binds, and the text that runs
// them. Shared so the client and the server read the same config files and the same
// command line.
//
//   cvar     a named value, kept as text and read as a number: `name` shows it,
//            `name value` or `set name value` sets it
//   command  a named function: `name arg arg...`
//   bind     a key's name and the text it runs when pressed. A bind to "+cmd" runs
//            "+cmd" on the press and "-cmd" on the release
//
// Text is commands separated by ';' or newlines. A command is words separated by
// spaces; "quotes" make one word of several, and // comments out the rest of the line.
//
// Everything runs at once, when it is executed: there is no buffer and no `wait`. The
// console knows key names only as text: the client names its keys (see console_key).
//
// A cvar set before it is registered (from the command line, or a config read before
// the code that owns it started) is kept, and the registration adopts its value. So the
// order at startup is free: exec the config, run the command line, then open the
// subsystems that register their cvars.
//
// The defaults are the code's: each cvar's registered value, and the binds the code sets
// before console_mark_defaults notes them. The settings files (config/) are written whole
// by console_save_files, every saved cvar in the file that keeps it with what it is
// beside it, commented out while it holds its default, and the keys likewise: so a file
// shows every setting it keeps, and a default changed by a later release reaches every
// player who hasn't set that thing otherwise. console_save keeps the older way, one file
// written back into in place: a line setting a saved cvar or binding a key is updated
// where it stands when its value changed, a bind's line goes when the key was unbound,
// and what the file didn't have goes after it, comments and all else kept.
//
// The built-in commands:
//   set / seta name value    set (seta also marks it to be saved)
//   reset name               back to its default
//   toggle name              0 <-> 1
//   vstr name                run the text a cvar holds
//   echo text...             print
//   exec file                run a config file (".cfg" added if it has no extension); in a
//                            file, one not there is passed over
//   bind key [text]          bind a key, or show its bind
//   unbind key / unbindall
//   cvarlist / cmdlist / bindlist [prefix]
