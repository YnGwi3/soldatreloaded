// The query: a server asked what it is playing, out of band, on its game port, by
// anyone (a server browser pinging it, the lobby checking it can be reached). One UDP
// datagram each way, outside ENet; the transport catches them before ENet sees them
// (net_answer_queries).
//
// Plain bytes, little-endian, not the game's bit-packed wire: the lobby reads these
// too, in another language, and the layout must hold still while the game's moves.
//
//   request  FF FF FF FF 'B' 'S' 'Q' 'i'  nonce:u32  zeros to QUERY_REQUEST_SIZE
//   reply    FF FF FF FF 'B' 'S' 'R' 'i'  nonce:u32  protocol:u16
//            players:u8 bots:u8 max_players:u8 mode:u8 flags:u8
//            hostname:(len:u8, bytes)  map:(len:u8, bytes)
//
// A request is padded to at least as long as any reply, so a forged source address
// gets its victim no more bytes than the forger sent. The nonce is the asker's, echoed,
// so a reply is matched to its request. Four 0xFF bytes in front are a header ENet
// itself never sends: a peer of 0xFFF with the compressed flag, which a host without a
// compressor (ours) drops.
