// A hosted game: the world with authority, the line everyone joins by, the players on
// it, the bots, and the rounds, ticked at TICK_RATE from whatever loop owns it. The
// dedicated server is one of these with a console around it (server/main.c); the
// client's Local Play is one of these inside the client, which then joins it over the
// loopback as any other client would, so a game against bots and a game hosted for
// friends are the same code and the same wire.
//
// The owner calls host_pump as often as it likes with the seconds since the last call:
// the ticks owed come out one whole tick at a time, the line heard before them and
// flushed after, and a round that ends (its limit, nextmap, a vote) begins the next on
// the rotation. net_init must have been called once already.
//
// A query on the host's port (network/query.h) is answered with the game being
// played: its name, map, mode, who is in it and whether it asks a password. A server
// browser asks it of every server it lists, and the lobby asks it to see that a
// server registering can be reached.
